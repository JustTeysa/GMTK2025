npcGreetingText = "Back already? Where's our mower? What do you mean this is ours? ours wasn't this blue! and didn't have nearly as many subwoofers..... Fine fine, well, while you're out could you at least give Holly back the one she lent me? [ Get Super Mower ] "
npcItemCompletedText = "Finally the proper mower! The perfect shade of blue, Extra cushy rider support and my special edition GMTK Ultra Max Sub system! See? That wasn’t so hard was it?[p]I mean honestly, how could you ever think that Other Mower was mine? Simply unbelievable that my own child can’t take in the wider world around them and just accept the facts that are staring them in the face! Children these days are so engrossed in their bloody Orbs living out spectacular fantasies when there's real world quests to go on.[p]By the God’s, Is this what children do all day long, day after day? When I was your age, my mother used to tell me, \"Deary, It's a big wide world out there. Go and see it all!” And she was right! I would adventure and galavant all across this world! I’d go to the Bank or spend a week up in Kirk's tree house. I would go out for days at a time! So at the very least, I expect you to spend more than 20 minutes galavanting around town before you come back here to that damn Orb![p]A true adventure begins at home you know. One day you’ll be miles away from home, seeing the grand sites. Maybe you’ll see Spinel’s magnificent garden, or even one day make it all the way to 7th Heaven Inn! Oh the adventures you could have. Such stories you will unravel.  Then then next thing you know. You'll be right back at my door, A heart full of courage and a story to tell….[p]… ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?[p]Your poor mother stands here, pouring her heart out to her one and only child. The least you could do is pay attention! I am absolutely gobsmacked at the level of disrespect I have to endure. To think I was so engrossed in my memories of childhood that I-[p]NO YOU MAY NOT COME IN!...[p] [p]…I DON’T CARE HOW MANY ORB JAM GAMES ARE LEFT! I AM MONOLOGUING[p]Now. Where was I? Right grand adventures of youth. True heroes of old who you wont find in that Orb jammer of your’s. [p]There was Pallas the Painter Prince [Art Team]: With naught but a brush, they are said to have defeated an entire army of Birch Ents hell bent on destroying the very earth on which we stand upon. This town would be hand crafted as a testament to the strength and beauty of those who would fall that faithful day. The power of each brush stroke would trap the town in a perpetual loop of endless autumn leaves. Or so the story goes.[p]Alongside, Sergio the Sculptor Sage [Art Team]: With hammer and chisel he would follow the lead of his Painter companion. Conjuring the grand halls that sit upon the magical autumnal lands. Weave the fabrics of our world into vast banners, and sew every sapling that would some day become the splendid timber that adorns our fine homes. Beauty is often said to be in the eye of the beholder, and none would behold more than He.[p]Let’s see your Orb tell you about them![p]Ok. So you may have access to the widest information network ever conceived. But I bet it won’t tell you the really juicy parts! [p]Even legends face hardships, and the unknown. Captain Dylan the Tactless [Sound and Writing] Knew this well: Torn between his love to weave tall tales and the simple enjoyment of a peaceful moment, this fool hardy captain would often stray too far from the path of the Grand Codex. Be it crashing through the wilds of the woods or accidentally stumbling into the Deep Lands ill prepared, nothing would slow the love of discovery. Much to the chagrin of his crew mates.  [p]But perhaps none knew better then Alina the Broken [Programming]: Moments before embarking upon her grand quest, disaster would knee-rly strike her down. Demons leapt from her very bones, attempting to bring an end to her greatest endeavor before it could even begin. She knew she kneeded to go on. Valiantly she would endure, fight back the very demons that plagued her bones and paint the very sky with Words torn right from the Grand Codex.[p]See? Stakes! Excitement! A third thing! …Not convinced yet? Are you sure you’re paying attention? Ok. cause these next ones only get crazier.[p]Sure things can be bad, and even a little too intense sometimes. But of course, there is the light that balances it all and brings hope to those lost in the unknown. Such as Saint Fran of The Grand Codex [God]: Worshipped by many, he descended upon a team of lost heroes to guide them to the creation of a perfect utopia. His knowledge seeped into the very land itself, becoming the Holy Code that courses through the lands. Shaping the destiny of all who would wander. Some say his codex caused the lands to go on forever and ever, even to this day it expands eternal, like a grand sphere.[p]You really don’t seem impressed by all this… the Man potentially created the universe with his pure Wizard charisma. His WizRizz. No? That's not a thing? Are you sure? Well it should be… perfectly good words right there…[p]Fine. What about life and its great mysteries? One such was Ivan, the Illusory Maestro [Music]: Though mysterious and recluse in nature, this master of the sensory arts drifted throughout the lands, bringing a purpose and joy to all who would hear. They say that a single note played by his skilled hands would lull all those who would hear it into an unending sense of bliss. Some claim that it was enough to make one mad, though those who have experienced it would deny that claim.[p]He wasn't alone either. Sir James of the Fjorbidden Tone [Audio] for instance: Deep within a forsaken cavern, where legends spoke of the echoes of ancients, this brave Knight would uncover the lost art of variety. Through many trials and tribulations he would learn of the First Sound. Its power crashed throughout the lands, breaking through the strongest stone and leaving awe in its wake. Those who endured would embrace the First Sound of the Gods.  [p]Well yeah, If it was your first time using Fjorbidden magic I’d assume you’d be a little loud too. Adults are guessing at life too. Spoiler! Nobody knows what they're doing. Well not all the time. But the pursuit of knowledge will take you to the wildest places. That's right, I have more stories![p]The legends only continue to grow from there. There was Corey, Warden of the Deep Lands [Programming]: Marched triumphantly through grand marshes, impossible mazes, and crumbling catacombs in search of a new home for his people. Guided through broken paths, He would uncover lost scriptures that would tell of treasures hidden within the twisted halls of the Deep Lands. Far below where the Holy code lies, he would maintain its integrity. Strengthening it so that the world would endure any hardship.  [p]In the end there are those who are often overlooked from the other legends, but believe me. All tales are worth telling. Which brings us to Tessa, Tsarina of Order and Reclamation [Production]: Out of chaos, comes order. Those of the Grand Codex know this to be true. And in the dying hours of the old world the people would turn to the one who could uphold its tenets. She would be the one to align the retainers of the Holy Code, and keep the light from fading in their souls. A driving force of first light gatherings and of the final checklist. The one who kept creation from looping into nothingness. [p]It takes courage to create something as magnificent as experience. And it takes true legends to stick it out and build together as a community. Our world may not be perfect, but it was founded about passion and determination. We stand here because of those Heroes of legend. And as our world loops into infinium, we thank those who would make us whole.[p][p]…[p]……[p]………...[p][p]THAT WAS NOT PREACHY! IT WAS EMPASSIONED. UGH FORGET IT.[p]GO ENJOY YOUR JAM."
